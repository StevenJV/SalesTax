This is a simple demonstration of an HTML form with input an a button which fires a JavaScript function to calculate values, which are then displayed. 

This project contains two pages, using HTML4 and HTML5 style input fields. 

There is an intentional error in the javascript function. This project was created to demonstrate features of Telerik's Test Studio product (see http://www.telerik.com/automated-testing-tools/blog/13-05-20/data-driven-test-automation.aspx)
